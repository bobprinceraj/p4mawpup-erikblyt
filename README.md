# Python-Web-Scraper


# you will need to pip install beautifulsoup4 and requests modules

#You will need to use c:\Python27\Scripts\virtualenv.exe -p C:\Python27\python.exe .lpvenv to create a virtual environment on your machine

#From there you will need to activate the environment using .lpvenv\Scripts\activate

#Then you will use pip install to install BOTH requests and beautifulsoup4 modules

#It should look something like pip install beautifulsoup4 or pip install requests

#Beyond that execute the program in python, by entering python webscrape.py into the command line
